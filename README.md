Discord Bot developed using JDA

- The bot uses 2 threads to periodically monitor the file from <a href="https://github.com/teoshinjiat/FFXIV-Menu/blob/main/ffxiv.log">ffxiv.log</a> and periodically edit the embed message in my personal discord server when only there are new changes in the log file.
- Its principle aim is to allow remotely monitor the log of my scripts from <a href="https://github.com/teoshinjiat/FFXIV-Menu">FFXIV Menu</a> when I'm away from the computer.
- Added Elapsed time for easier monitoring, longer elapsed time on Verbose Log means the script definitely hanged
